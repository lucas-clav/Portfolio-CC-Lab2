My partners for this assignment were Damini and Ethan. For the corpse’s head, I referenced the sketch I drew in lecture with a few other students. Damini contributed a sketch of Cinnamoroll, a Sanrio character, and Ethan shared a drawing of Doraemon, a manga and anime figure. As a result, I coded the final corpse by giving it Cinnamoroll’s body and Doraemon’s legs, while keeping my original cat head at the top.
