I wanted to create an optical illusion using color. After researching, I based my project on the Bezold Effect, which shows how surrounding colors influence our perception. Named after Wilhelm von Bezold, this illusion makes patterns appear to change color as they blend with nearby hues. To demonstrate it, I overlaid an edited photo of a cat on alternating blue and yellow stripes. Though designers often use this effect, I see strong potential for it in fashion, where woven colors could shift a garment’s appearance from different angles.
