Goooooooaaaaallll is a clock that measures time through the rhythm of the Premier League season. The league runs annually from August 15 to May 24, so the clock tracks time in nine-month increments. A football, acting as the clock’s hand, rotates around the canvas. As it passes over the stadium, the lights turn on—signaling the start of the season—and off again at the end, mirroring the cycle of stadiums in and out of use.

My initial idea was to create a clock based on seasonal changes, such as fluctuations in rent prices. However, I shifted toward football because of the upcoming FIFA World Cup. At first, I considered using the World Cup’s four-year cycle, but realized that stadiums host matches every year through domestic leagues. This project taught me how recurring annual events, like sports seasons, can become alternative systems for tracking time.
